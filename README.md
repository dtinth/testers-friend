# Tester’s friend

A tool for **semi-automated testing.** Use cases:

- For when you want to do **exploratory testing** but doing everything manually is too tedious.
- When you don’t have the resource to set up a full test automation system but would still benefit from little automation here and there. At least less efficient stuff can be done more efficiently.

This tool:

- Opens up **Chromium** (Google Chrome) with a JavaScript console to let you use JavaScript to automate it.
- Based on **Puppeteer** so you can reuse the knowledge to write fully-automated tests with Puppeteer.
